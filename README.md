# hyaline
_hyaline_: /ˈhaɪəlɪn/, "having a glassy, translucent appearance"

A pure CSS framework built on modern CSS3 rules (at this point, there is no plan to
integrate JavaScript components.  I'm definitely open to change this!)

I've been using Bootstrap for a long time, and recently started using Material Design
and Semantic UI.  Not wanting to reinvent the wheel, but with a desire to learn,
I decided to roll my own framework.
